Drop muxed in to your `$PATH` and take it for a spin. Happy to receive feature requests or bug reports!

## Muxed

**Muxed**: Provides the functionality for creating, opening and parsing your project configs to
launch a TMUX session.

**Snapshot**: __Experimental__ : Create a config file based on a running tmux
session.

## Installation

### Download a release:

See the [releases](https://github.com/brianp/muxed/releases) page for muxed packages.
Download and untar the package as desired.
Make sure the bin is somewhere in your `$PATH`. I
generally move the bins in to `/usr/local/bin`.

```shell
$ tar -xvzf muxed-VERSION-SYSTEM.tar.gz
x muxed
$ mv muxed /usr/local/bin
$ muxed --help
$ muxed my_new_project
```

### From Homebrew taps

This will add a [tap](https://github.com/brianp/homebrew-muxed) to install a pre-compiled Muxed bin.

```shell
$ brew tap brianp/homebrew-muxed
$ brew install muxed_bin
```

## For development

### With Docker

Docker commands are long so I use a make file that points all the commands to a
runing docker container.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:brianp/muxed.git
$ export MUXED_ENV=nix
$ make build
$ make start
$ make cargo cmd='test --workspace --color=always'
```

### From source:

Have rust stable installed.
Clone this repo. Then run cargo to build the source, and again use cargo to run the app.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:brianp/muxed.git
$ cargo build
$ cargo run -- --help
$ cargo test --workspace --color=always
```

## Setup

### 1. Create a new project file.

If this is your first run, muxed will create the `~/.muxed/` directory for you.

```shell
$ muxed new my_project
Looks like this is your first time here. Muxed could't find the configuration directory: `/root/.muxed`
Creating that now üëå

‚úå The template file my_project.yml has been written to /root/.muxed
Happy tmuxing!
```

The generated template will look like this (but with some inline docs):
```yaml
root: "~/"
windows:
  - editor:
      layout: "main-vertical"
      panes: ["vi", "ls -alh"]
  - processes: "ls /proc"
  - logs: "tail -f /var/log/dmesg"
```

This config will create a new tmux session with three windows named *editor*,
*processes* and *logs*. By default your view will be on the first window opened,
on the first pane, which in this case is *vi* in the *editor* window. The first window will have
two panes split vertically, the left will have the editor *vi* running and the
right will have a shell listing of your current working directory.


### 2. Edit your template
Now you can use your favourite editor and make changes to the config as desired.
This makes the assumption you have an `$EDITOR` env var set.

```shell
$ muxed edit my_project
```

### 3. Open TMUX with your muxed config
```shell
$ muxed my_project
```

## Usage Options

```shell

    muxed snapshot [flags] [options] <project>
    muxed (-h | --help)
    muxed (-v | --version)

Flags:

    -f                  Overwrite existing file if one exists
    --debug             Prints debug information while executing (project opening only)
    -h, --help          Prints help information
    -v, --version       Prints version information

Options:
    -p <project_dir>    The directory your project config files live in. Defaults to ~/.muxed/
    -t <session>        The name of the running TMUX session to codify

Args:
    <project>           The name of your project to open

Subcommands:
    list                             List the availiable project configs
    edit <project>                   Edit an existing project file
