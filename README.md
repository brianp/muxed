Muxed - ‚ÄúAnother TMUX project manager‚Äù
=====
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianp/muxed.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brianp/muxed)

Drop muxed in to your `$PATH` and take it for a spin. Happy to receive feature requests or bug reports!

## Muxed

**Muxed**: Provides the functionality for creating, opening and parsing your project configs to
launch a TMUX session.

**Snapshot**: __Experimental__ : Create a config file based on a running tmux
session.

## Installation

### Download a release:

See the [releases](https://github.com/brianp/muxed/releases) page for muxed packages.
Download and untar the package as desired. The complete package contains
both `muxed`, `muxednew`, and `muxedsnapshot`.
Make sure all bins are somewhere in your `$PATH`. I
generally move the bins in to `/usr/local/bin`.

```shell
$ tar -xvzf muxed-VERSION-SYSTEM.tar.gz
x muxed
$ mv muxed /usr/local/bin
$ muxed --help
$ muxed my_new_project
```

### From Homebrew taps

This will add a tap to install a pre-compiled muxed bin.

```shell
$ brew tap brianp/homebrew-muxed
$ brew install muxed_bin
```

### From source:

Have rust stable (or nightly at the risk of it not working) installed.
Clone this repo. Then run cargo to build the source, and again use cargo to run the app.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:brianp/muxed.git
$ cargo build
$ cargo run -- --help
$ cargo run my_new_project
```

## Setup

### 1. Create a new project file.

If this is your first run, muxed will create the `~/.muxed/` directory for you.

```shell
$ muxed new my_project
Looks like this is your first time here. Muxed could't find the configuration directory: `/home/vagrant/.muxed`
Creating that now üëå

‚úå The template file my_project.yml has been written to /home/vagrant/.muxed
Happy tmuxing!
```

The generated template will look like this (but with some inline docs):
```yaml
root: "~/"
windows:
  - editor:
      layout: "main-vertical"
      panes: ["vi", "ls -alh"]
  - processes: "ls /proc"
  - logs: "tail -f /var/log/dmesg"
```

This config will create a new tmux session with three windows named *editor*,
*processes* and *logs*. By default your view will be on the first window opened,
on the first pane, which in this case is *vi* in the *editor* window. The first window will have
two panes split vertically, the left will have the editor *vi* running and the
right will have a shell listing of your current working directory.


### 2. Edit your template
Now you can use your favourite editor and make changes to the config as desired.

```shell
$ $EDITOR ~/.muxed/my_project.yml
```

### 3. Open TMUX with your muxed config
```shell
$ muxed my_project
```

## Usage Options

```shell
Usage:
    muxed [options] <project>
    muxed new [options] <project>
    muxed snapshot [options] <project>
    muxed (-h | --help)
    muxed (-v | --version)

Flags:
    -d                  If you want to create a muxed session without connecting to it
    -f                  Overwrite existing file if one exists
    -h, --help          Prints help information
    -v, --version       Prints version information

Options:
    -p <project_dir>    The directory your project config files live in. Defaults to ~/.muxed/
    -t <tmux_session>   The name of the running TMUX session to codify

Args:
    <project>           The name of your project to open

Subcommands:
    new <project>                         To create a new project file
    snapshot -t <tmux_session> <project>  Capture a running session and create a config file for it
```
