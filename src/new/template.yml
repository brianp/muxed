# pre_window is a command or an array of commands that will be executed in all
# windows and panes before window and pane specific commans.
# ex:
# pre_window: rbenv shell 2.1.2
#
# pre_window:
#   - rvm 2.1.2
#   - ls .

# Windows is required and lets you define the windows you would like opened in
# your tmux session. This can be made as a list of key value pairs, where the
# key is the window name, and the value is a system command to execute.
# ex: 
# windows:
#   - processes: "ls /proc"
#   - logs: "tail -f /var/log/dmesg"
#
# You can also define windows as an array with no system commands to execute:
# ex:
# windows: ['first', 'second', 'last']
windows:
  - editor:
      layout: "main-vertical"
      panes: ["vi", "ls -alh"]
  - processes: "ls /proc"
  - logs: "tail -f /var/log/dmesg"
